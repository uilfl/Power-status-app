The company is planning a marketing campaign for a clothing brand and needs your help in developing an advertising strategy. Your goal is to maximize brand exposure and sales conversion rates. With a total budget of **1 million NT dollars**, you must allocate funds between **online and offline advertising channels** within the budget constraints.  

**Online Advertising:**  
This includes social media, search engine ads, and email campaigns. It typically reaches a wide younger audience but is highly competitive and requires precise targeting strategies.  

**Offline Advertising:**  
This includes outdoor billboards, event sponsorships, and in-store promotions. It is effective at attracting specific local target audiences but has a more limited reach and higher costs.
